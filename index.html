<h2>
    Want Todd to live somewhere else? <br>
    Well, Todd needs help moving. Try dragging him with your mouse. <br>
    Too slow for you? Just click somewhere and that should work as well.<br>
    Or you could just use your arrowkeys I guess. <br>
    
</h2>

    <h1>Not happy with your Todd's size? <br>
        Increase his size with '+'! <br>
        Think your Todd is too big? <br>
        Decrease his size with '-'  <br>
        Are you scared your Todd will never look normal again? <br>
        Reset your Todd's size with 'R'! <br>
